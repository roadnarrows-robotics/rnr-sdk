Design Notes for Library libbotsense
------------------------------------

Design:
  The libbotsense is the base library used by both the BotSense bsProxy server
and any BotSense client application or client add-on library. Besides defining
the shared bsProxy message set, the library provides common routines shared
between the server and client, plus base client-specific support. 

Files:
  bsLibClient.c       Client specific functions and base communcation support.
  bsLibInternal.h     Library internal glue.
  bsLibServer.c       Client specific functions to communicate with server
                      terminated messages.
  bsLibError.c        Common server and client error functons.
  bsLibUtils.c        Common server and client utilities.
  bsProxyMsgs.c       The bsProxy server - client message set and routines.
                      Auto-generated from bsProxyMsgs.xml netmsgs XML
                      specification.
