RoadNarrows Robotics Application Kit

## Description
The RoadNarrows <b>app</b>lication <b>kit</b> is a C++ Software
Development Kit (SDK) used for rapid application and package develop.
The <b>appkit</b> comprises C++ class headers and libraries.

The target execution platforms are:
* (Mostly) POSIX compliant platforms such as Linux.
* Embedded (odroid, gumstix, etc) and hosts (laptops, desktops, etc).

To this end, the deliberate design decisions were made to:
* Use the C++98 standard and compiler tool chain.
* No Boost.
* Limit use of additional system libraries other than "readily" available.
