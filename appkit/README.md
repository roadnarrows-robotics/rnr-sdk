RoadNarrows Robotics Application Tool Kit

## Description
The RoadNarrows **app**lication tool **kit** appkit provides a set of C++ class
headers and libraries for rapid application and packages develop.

The target execution platforms are:
* (Mostly) POSIX compliant platforms such as Linux.
* Embedded (odroid, gumstix, etc) and hosts (laptops, desktops, etc).

To this end, the deliberate design decisions were made to:
* Use the C++98 standard and compiler tool chain.
* No Boost.
* Limit use of additional system libraries other than "readily" available.
