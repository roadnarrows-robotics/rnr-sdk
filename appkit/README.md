RoadNarrows Robotics Application Tool Kit

## Description
The RoadNarrows APPlication tool KIT appkit provides a set of C++ class headers
and libraries to rapidly develop applications and packages.

The target execution platforms are:
* (Mostly) POSIX compliant platforms such as Linux.
* Embedded and hosts (laptops and desktops).

To this end, the deliberate design decisions made were to:
* Use the C++98 standard and compiler tool chain.
* No Boost.
* Limit use of additional system libraries other than "readily" available.
