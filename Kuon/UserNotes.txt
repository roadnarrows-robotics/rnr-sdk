Some Safety Awareness
---------------------
1. The physical Emergency Stop button is your friend.
2. The Kuon and laptop related software is brand new and not fully tested.
3. As long as the Kuon is powered, it keeps the last user specified state. So
   if you set the governor to 90%, unplug the Xbox, replug it, go to Start,
   the governor is still at 90% !!!
4. Best to set the governor to ~20% before leaving the Kuon.
5. Best to pause the Xbox360 during idle times to prevent accidental button
   presses.
6. Wonky wifi comm can create bizzare behavior.

THE KUON IS 250 POUNDS OF STEEL and LEAD THAT CAN MOVE AT 20MPH.
