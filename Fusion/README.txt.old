Description:
------------
Fusion is a RoadNarrows-developed robotics demonstration application. 
It is free to use, modify, and distribute. See EULA for more details.

Fusion is a Gluon Client that fuses a vRobot Gluon Server and/or a vBrain 
Gluon Server into one controlling structure. Gluon is the simple control
and information exchange interface between the client and server.

Both the vBrains and vRobots are plugable python modules. Any derived
application conforming to the vBrain and vRobot interface will work within
the Fusion construct. 

Supported client-server models are:
 Fusion(client) <--Gluon--> vRobot(server)
 Fusion(client) <--Gluon--> vBrain(server)
 Fusion(client) <--Gluon(2)--> [vBrain(server) <--peer--> vRobot(server)]

Supported Subpackages:
----------------------

  Core      - Fusion core subpackage including the Reactor.
  Utils     - Fusion genera purpose utilities subpackage.
  Gui       - Fusion Graphical User Interface windows, dialogs,
              and utilities.
  Hemisson  - K-Team Hemisson robot subpackage.
  Khepera   - K-Team KheperaII robot subpackage.
  KHR1      - Kondo KHR-1 humanoid robot subpackage.
  Templates - User development templates.
  Demos     - Simple Fusion demos.

System Requirements:
--------------------

Windows XP or Linux. 
It requires a Python installation, Python 2.4 or better. 

Tested Platforms: Linux Fedora Core 5, Windows XP
    Although not tested on other host platforms, if the above python 
    requirements are met, it should still work...
RS232 cabled serial or Bluetooth serial port for connection to Hemisson and
Khepera robots.
Kondo hacked TTL-RS232 cabled serial port for KHR-1 robot.

**  WARNING WARNING WARNING  **
Fusion 0.10.0 does not work very well on Windows XP with Python 2.4. There
are unexpected interactions between the threading module and the Tkinter
mainloop() which causes window management to fail and lock. Hopefully,
this can be fixed in an upcoming dot release.

Supported Robots:
-----------------

K-Team Robots: Hemisson and KheperaI, KheperaII
Kondo Robots:  KHR-1

Fusion 0.10.0 includes support for the Hemisson and the Khepera robots by
K-Team and the KHR-1 robot by Kondo.
See the following sites for more information about these robots.
  http://www.roadnarrowsrobotics.com
  http://www.k-team.com
  http://www.kondo-robot.com/html/Info_En.html

The Hemisson modules supported include the Linear Camera, Text-to-Speech,
and the Ultra-Sonic Sensor. If you use these modules it is required that you
use the modified Hemisson OS HemiOs-1.50RNf.HEX available from 
http://roadnarrowsrobotics.com/support/hemisson/supHem-Base.html.
To update the Hemisson with this OS, please see the Hemisson User Guide. 

Future: 

Robots that are planned to be supported in the future include:
  KHR-2HV humanoid robot by Kondo
  KheperaIII wheeled robot by K-Team
  e-puck wheeled robot by GCtronic
  MANOI AT01 humanoid robot by Kyosho
  All future robots built by RoadNarrows LLC. 
Please contact us at oneway@roadnarrowsrobotics.com if you have any requests or 
code for additional robots or brains to be included in the Fusion package. 

Brains:
-------

There are also some example "brains" included in Fusion for both the Hemisson
and the Khepera robots. 
See the Khepera and Hemisson directories under Fusion for more information.

Documentation:
--------------

Use a web-browser to view the index.html file in the main Fusion-x.y directory.
The Fusion Application Programming Interface (API) is documented here.
The subpackages are also described here. 
 

Configuration Files and Environment Variables:
----------------------------------------------

fusion.ini  - fusion 'ini' file specifying fusion start-up configuration.
fusion.pth  - python file to specify fusion location (Use this or PYTHONPATH).

PYTHONPATH    - Alternative to the fusion.pth file. Modify this variable 
                to include the Fusion path. 
FUSIONSTARTUP - ini file that specifies site installation, group parameters. 
                It isn't necessary to define this for Fusion to run properly.
FUSION        - Isn't necessary to modify this. 
                Only use this to override where Fusion exists.

Installation Notes:
------------------- 
-------------------

Windows XP
----------


First-time Installation Instructions:


1. Python 2.4.x, "Python for Windows extensions", and the pyserial package 
must be installed.  Skip this step if you've done this for other tools.

If you need to upgrade your python installation, it is recommended that you
first uninstall your old python installation. Don't forget to uninstall all
three packages.  The pyserial package and the Python for Windows extensions
package can be uninstalled through your Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs. 


The original source of these files can be found on python.org, 
sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/, and pyserial.sourceforge.net, 
however, copies are available at roadnarrowsrobotics.com for your convenience.

Eg. install the python packages in the following order and it is recommended to
accept the default installation locations:

python-2.4.2.msi
pywin32-207.win32-py2.4.exe
pyserial-2.2.win32.exe

Verify that python was installed correctly. You can go to your Start Menu, 
Program Files, and open up IDLE from the python 2.4 path. 


2. Copy the Fusion-x.y.tar.gz  file to your destination directory. For example,

c:\src

and untar the Fusion-x.y.tar.gz in this directory. 
We use WinZip as an extraction tool. ("Extract to here" option). 
Ignore any trailing garbage errors. 


3. There are two mechanisms for Fusion to find Python. Either one should work.

The first way is using ".pth" files. 
Open c:\src\Fusion-x.y\Fusion\Fusion.pth with notepad and edit 
it to specify the location of the top-level installation directory of Fusion 
from step 2. 

Eg: c:\src\Fusion-0.10.0

Copy this pth file to the site-packages directory under your python
installation.
Eg. to : c:\Python24\Lib\site-packages

The second way is by adding the above path to the PYTHONPATH environment
variable.
 
4. In the Fusion\bin directory, double-click on Fusion.bat . Have fun!


Upgrade Instructions: 


A. Follow steps 2, 3 and 4 with the new version of Fusion. 

B. Your home directory has a fusion.ini file with defaults, settings, robot
paths, etc. that have been created by the previous version of Fusion. 
You must delete this file in order to pick up any new changes, such as new
robots and new brains. A new fusion.ini file is automatically created for you
by Fusion. 

However, if you have modified this file with special user preferences, you may
want to keep your changes, do not delete this file. 
It is recommended that you rename the old fusion.ini file and then let Fusion
generate a new fusion.ini for you. Then add your changes back to the new
fusion.ini. 

In Windows, the fusion.ini file is saved to 
C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\fusion.ini



Linux 
-----

1. It is most likely that your Linux installation has Python2.4 or greater
installed.  Type "which python" to verify you have your python environment in
your path.  You may, however, need to install pyserial to support the
Serial Port functions. This module is available from pyserial.sourceforge.net . 

2. Copy the Fusion-x.y.tar.gz  file to your destination directory. For example,

/usr/local

and untar the Fusion-x.y.tar.gz in this directory. You probably need root
privileges for the /usr/local directory. 

For example: 
   cd /usr/local
   tar xzvf Fusion-0.10.0.tar.gz 


3. There are two mechanisms for Fusion to find Python. Either one should work.

The first way is using ".pth" files. 

Edit /<destination direcory>/Fusion-x.y/Fusion/Fusion.pth to specify the 
location of the top-level installation directory of Fusion from step 2.

Eg: vi /usr/local/Fusion-0.10.0/Fusion/Fusion.pth

Copy this pth file to the site-packages directory under your python
installation. 

Eg: cp Fusion.pth /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages

If you don't want to use a ".pth" file, the second way for Fusion to find
Python is to modify your PYTHONPATH environment variable. 

4. In the Fusion/bin directory, invoke the Fusion executable.

Eg: cd /usr/local/Fusion-0.10.0/Fusion/bin
    ./Fusion

Have fun! 


Upgrade Instructions: 


A. Follow steps 2, 3 and 4 with the new version of Fusion. 

B. Your home directory has a .fusion file with defaults, settings,
robot paths, etc.  that have been created by the previous version of Fusion. 
You must delete this file in order to pick up any new changes, such as new
robots and new brains. A new .fusion file is automatically created for you by
Fusion. 

However, if you have modified this file with special user preferences, you may
want to keep your changes, do not delete this file. 
It is recommended that you rename the old .fusion file and then let Fusion
generate a new .fusion file for you.  Then add your changes back to the
new .fusion . 


In Linux, the .fusion file is saved to your home directory.


Operation:
----------
----------

Linux - In the Fusion/bin directory, invoke the Fusion executable.

Eg: cd /usr/local/Fusion-x.y/Fusion/bin
    ./Fusion

Windows - Double click on Fusion.bat in the 
<installation dir>\Fusion-x.y\Fusion\bin directory 


Tutorial:

Khepera Example:
----------------

This is a typical scenerio for loading and connecting to a robot and then 
loading and running a brain on the robot. You may either use the image icons to
select the functions, or use the Top-level menu bar. These instructions
describe using the menu bar. 

Have the Khepera turned on, and connected to your computer via a serial
connection, such as COM1. A COM port that was created by a Bluetooth connection
is fine too.  Make sure no other application such as Hyperterminal is connected
to the Khepera.

1. Select a robot plugin. 
Select "Robot", then "Select ...".
Select a vRobots Plugin Directory, and a specific Plugin Module. 
Press "OK". 

2. Load the robot plugin into Fusion. 
Select "Exec", then "Load/Unload".
(Note - if a brain was previously selected and found to be incompatible with
the robot, you will get an error. You must deselect the brain first, or select
a new brain.  You can do this through the "brain" menu). 

3. Go back into the Robot menu. Notice now there are more choices.
Select "Robot" --- "Options". Unselect the Sensor group "GP2D120IR Sensors". 
Select all the other Sensors listed. Press "Okay".

4. In the main Fusion window, select "Robot" -- "Connect". 
Type in your COM port (e.g. COM1), and choose the baud rate that the Khepera is
set to. Click "Okay". 

5. Bring up the robot's shell window. Go to "Robot" --- "Shell". 
Type "help". Invoke various commands in the Shell to verify communication and
response with the robot. For example "version" and "moveto 30 30" .
Familiar Khepera commands can be done using "rawcmd", eg. "rawcmd D,10,-10"

6. From the "robot" menu, select the "Navigator" and the "Trip" windows.

7. Begin execution of the robot. Go to "Exec" --- "Play". 

8. Try driving the robot with the Nav window, and observe the updates in the
Trip window.

9. Stop execution through "Exec" --- "Stop".
Unload the robot: "Robot" --- "Load/Unload".
Observe that the COM port is disconnected and the robot-associated windows
close.  

10. Select a brain to demonstrate. Select "Brain" --- "Select ..." and select
Khepera's vBrainLoopy. 

11. Press Load/Unload. ("Exec" --- "Load/Unload"). Notice now under "Brain"
you may select and modify "Brain Options...".  For a description of the loaded
brain, go to "Help" --- "About Brain".  

12. Open up all of your robot windows again ("Robot" --- "Trip", "Navigator",
"Shell")

13. Connect to the robot through the serial port ("Robot" --- "Connect").

14. Play or run the Brain on the Robot. "Exec" --- "Play". You should see the
robot follow a path which is a virtual circle as specified by the options. 
The Trip window should show the path that the robot follows as returned by the
robot's odometry.  

15. Stop execution. "Exec" --- "Stop". 

16. Exit Fusion. "File" --- "Exit". 



Known Problems and Work-arounds
-------------------------------
-------------------------------

1. 06-March-09 
A fatal error occurs if you have a Fusion window which has part of it outside of the
visible screen and updates (text or graphics) are made to that window by Fusion.
This occurs both in Windows and Linux. The work-around is to make sure your windows
are entirely visible on your computer screen. It is suggested that if you want to
move or resize your windows, first "pause" your robot execution, if it is currently 
running, then move/resize your windows, and finally resume/run your program.
