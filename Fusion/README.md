## Description
Fusion is a RoadNarrows-developed robotics demonstration application. 
It is free to use, modify, and distribute. See EULA for more details.

Fusion is a Gluon Client that fuses a vRobot Gluon Server and/or a vBrain 
Gluon Server into one controlling structure. Gluon is the simple control
and information exchange interface between the client and server.

Both the vBrains and vRobots are plugable python modules. Any derived
application conforming to the vBrain and vRobot interface will work within
the Fusion construct.
