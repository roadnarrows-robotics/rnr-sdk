# RoadNarrows Robotic Software Development Kits
The rnr-sdk git repository holds software packages that support the
RoadNarrows Robotics products, sensors, and intelligent systems.

Originally the RNR SDK were separate git repositories. At end-of-life, the
kits were loosely integrated into one repository. 

See MakeAll to make all kits.
