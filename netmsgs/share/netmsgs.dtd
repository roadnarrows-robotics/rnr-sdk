    This is RoadNarrows LLC NetMsgs DTD, which supports the definitions of
    messages intended to be packed and unpacked in architecture agnostic 
    order and sent and received across a disparate set of networked nodes.

    The NetMsgs package supports the Presentation Level of the OSI model.
    It does not include support to handle the transmission of messages across
    the network nor does it "know" how the applications interpretate the
    messages.

    Typical usage:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE netmsgs PUBLIC "-//www.roadnarrows.com//DTD NETMSGS 1.0//EN"
          "http://www.roadnarrows.com/DTD/netmsgs/1.0/netmsgs.dtd">
    <netmsgs>
    <meta>
    ...
    </meta>

    <field_types>
    ...
    </field_types>

    <msgdef>
    ...
    </msgdef>

    <msgdef>
    ...
    </msgdef>
    </netmsgs>

    The URI used as a system identifier with the public identifier allows
    the user agent to download the DTD and entity sets as needed.

    This version of the transitional DTD is: 1.0
