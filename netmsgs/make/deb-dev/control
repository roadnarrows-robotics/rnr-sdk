Description: RoadNarrows network messaging packing/unpacking library.
  The NetMsgs package provides both build-time and run-time support of
  networked messaging presented in a format that is both machine architecture
  independent and language independent. The messages can sent between
  networked nodes over a communication channel. In the OSI Model, the NetMsgs
  package supports the Presentation Layer. The lower communication levels
  and the Application Layer are not in the scope of NetMsgs.
